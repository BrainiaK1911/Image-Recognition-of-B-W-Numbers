# Image Recognition of Black & White Numbers using FFT
User must take an image of numbers (0-9) of the same font, convertng them to Black and White, and extracting the FFT component of each image.
Storing the FFT of each image in a database as a lookup table in order to match the FFT of images of numbers used as input with the FFT of numbers previously stored in the database.


User may be able to implement the above process for different fonts.

Software: Matlab
Font: Times New Roman
